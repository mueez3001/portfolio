            <h>Dr. Pierce & Dr. Baur</h>
            <p>You’re a system administrator with broad access to enterprise systems. Your supervisor has asked you to begin archiving all of the emails and web activity logs of one of your coworkers. Typically requests of this nature are initiated through a formal communication from your campus’s legal office. You feel that this request is inappropriate and possibly at odds with standard campus procedure and processes.
You raise your concerns with your supervisor, but are told that this is a sensitive matter, and details cannot be shared with you. After thinking more about the conversation you had with your supervisor, you are under the impression that you might lose your job if you persist in discussing the matter further or if you refuse to carry out the task.</p>

    <li>Describe the Ethical/Legal issues along with identifying the stakeholders involved. What do you think are the ethical/legal issue(s) represented in this case? Who are the individuals or groups most impacted by these ethical/legal issue(s)?</li>
    <li>Identify the available options for addressing these ethical/legal issues. What are the various options available for addressing the ethical/legal issue(s) raised by this case? In other words, what alternatives are available for consideration?</li>
    <li>Identify the Ethical Approaches / Reasoning Strategies or Criteria for Evaluating Alternatives. Check out this article (https://www.scu.edu/media/ethics-center/resources/making.pdf) for various approaches you can use. Which one(s) do you think would be most helpful for weighing your options? Are there other criteria that you would want to consider?</li>
    <li>Apply the Criteria (i.e., put together a list of pros and cons based on the criteria for each of the alternatives that you have identified).</li>
    <li>What is your final decision and why do you think this is the best way to go?
</li>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<p>
This is a very easy question to answer. First I would ask my supervisor why, am I archiving all of the emails and web activity logs of one of your coworkers. Then I would bring my concert about the policies for the campus. Then I would explain to my supervisor that this is very sensitive information and it will be ethically wrong for me to archive coworkers information. I will also explain to my supervisor that in order for me to start this process I will need a formal request from the communication department from your campus’s legal office. KEYWORD LEGAL OFFICE.
This is where I would re-educate my supervision on our policies, procedures, and Code of Conduct. Generally there are 5 code of conduct that are recognized and implemented all across the IT profession.</p>

<li>Integrity</li>
<li>Objectivity</li>
<li>Professional competence</li>
<li>Professional behavior</li>
<li>Confidentiality</li>

<p>If my supervisor still insists I would contact the communication department from your campus’s legal office for an approval. That would be the right thing to do in my book, because if it's that sensitive matter the campus legal department should know, but if it is theft honestly I am no F.B.I agent, I am not qualified enough to play detective at the workplace.
I have worked as an administrative assistant before and as far as I know, the employee would know that he/she is being monitored by the company and he/she could be on a probationary period.
In conclusion, this is a very sensitive matter then my supervisor should involve the HR department or Law enforcement. Ethically I cannot archive any coworkers information without a consent. If I don’t do the job my supervisor will fire me and I have to do the right thing, and when I accept the fact that I will be fired I will personally contact the HR department to let them know about the request.</p>

<p>Pros
If I say Yes to my superior.
That would be unethical.
If is do archive the emails and web logs
I will be the only person suspected to monitor an employee without consent.
If I say yes
I would be breaking company police.</p>

<p>Cons
If I say No to my supervisor
I will be fired
If I ask my coworker about the situation
I will be fired
If I contact the HR department
I will be fired
If I contact the communication department or legal office about this very sensitive situation.
I will be fired</p>

<p>In the end I would advise my supervisor to contact the communication office so they can send me the form request for that he/she is asking or contact the local authorities, or contact the HR department, As my supervisor is in a very sensitive situation where he need me to archive information, I am not accessing someone's sensitive information upon proper request, even tho I its company property. Because I am the only one linked to it and if there is a crime being committed I am the only one linked to it.
So without the proper request my supervisor will not receive the information he/she has requested.</p>

              <h2>Case Assignment Case 3-1 You Can’t Get There From Here: UBER SLOW ON DIVERSITY</h2>

<li>Susan Fowler’s complaint of being the target of sexual harassment by her manager would be categorized as falling under which employment law?
</li>

<li>Which Types(s) of harassment was Ms. Flower exposed to?</li>

<li>What actions, if any, has Uber taken to limit their liability relative to sexual harassment charges?</li>

<li>Uber’s diversity report indicates that 36% of Uber’s workforce is made up of women (15% in technical jobs); 50% of Uber’s employees in the United States are white, while 9% are black and 6% are Hispanic. Are they violations of any EEOC and Affirmative Action Laws?</li>

<li>Why Does Diversity matter in general and more specifically to Uber?
</li>

<li>What benefits and challenges does Uber derive from a more diverse workforce?
</li>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits disciplinary action on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, in all areas of the employment relationship.</p>

<p>Ms. Flowers was exposed to Sexual harassment, where the manager was asking or trying to ask for sexual favor, which is also known as Unwelcoming sexual advances. I also believe Ms. Flowers were exposed to Hostile work environment. Because the manager was asking other female workers for sexual favors, and no action was taken against the manager. 
</p>

<p>I feel like they did not, but they put out a statement apologizing for their manager's action, had a board member and female testify that how great the environment is here at Uber. During this time they were working on creating policy and procedures for the company. Uber also dedicated 3 million dollars over the next 3 years to help women and different minorities learn tech and get into the workforce.</p>

<li>I think Uber did not violate any Violation of EEOC and Affirmative action law
</li>
<li>EEOC is a federal agency that enforces to give job, to be given to employee regardless of there color, sex, ethnicity. And Uber has all the minority even tho, the percentage is lower in Afican American and Hispanic employees, Uber still gives opportunity to employees.
Affirmative action law helps give jobs to minorities, and Uber is giving jobs to them too.
So, no Uber is not violating any EEOC or Affirmative Action Law.

</li>
<p>As it says in Chapter 3 page 95 title; WHY DO WE NEED DIVERSITY? 
Diversity is important because white population continues to shrink and the minority population is growing. That means increased sales, different suppliers, and more business opportunities from different people whether they are Indian, Chinese, Afican American, they will feel comfortable using company products and its services. You get a wider customer base from different cultures or backgrounds, and if they have a welcoming feeling to their company and cater to all kinds of people that is money coming in from all directions. That is a successful campaign for a company in my eyes, and Uber is doing that.
</p>

<p>Uber could benefit if they hired more diverse employees. They should have serious diversity classes and education videos. Uber should retrain their managers or at least hold them accountable, because at the end they are liability to the company. Manager should be a role model and add value to the company.
