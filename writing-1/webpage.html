                        <p><b>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief ans small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data</b></p>

                        <p style="color: #8395a7;">
                               This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective orgnaization and presentation and need not be reducded to meaningless "bite-sized" chuncks of data, as simplification usually does.

                        Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simpkicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.

                <h3>Questions</h2>
                        <p>Please answer the following question below. Remember to makeup the information properly using HTML
                </p>

                <h4>
                        Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute. 
                </h4>
                <p>Image alt text is used to describe your image textually so that search engines and screen readers (software used by the visually impaired) can understand what that image is. ... On the other hand, the image title tag is simply used to provide an image with a title, but it's less important for SEO than the alt tag</p>
                <h4>
Please provide an example of how to make up a definition from the dictionary below                </h4>
                <p>To cite a dictionary definition in APA Style, start with the author of the dictionary (usually an organization), followed by the publication year, the word you're citing, the dictionary name, the publisher (if not already listed as author), and the URL.</p>
                <h4>
                        Provide an example of link pointing to your favirot site
